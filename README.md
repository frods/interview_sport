## Interviewing is a Sport

Job interviews are stressful, there is no way to deny that. There is a way of 
thinking about them that makes them easier to deal with and succeed at. An
individual interview is the culmination of lots of training and practice, 
similar to a sporting event. Also similar to a sporting event the outcome of 
an individual interview is not always the most important thing.

Certainly the stakes are high. Nailing that big interview can really change your
life. Moving your career forward and getting you a big raise that you were 
looking for. However it is important to recognize that the outcome does not 
define your potential. Interviews can be lost for a multitude of reasons,
most of which are outside your control.

- You got stumped on that one question you hadn't prepared for.
- You stumbled on something you knew but couldn't describe it clearly. 
- You gave an answer in a way that the interviewer wasn't expecting or didn't
 understand. 
- The interviewer didn't *click* with you.
- The position was filled internally.

Some of these things can be dealt with by practicing more, but some of it is 
just a fluke which can be summed up as having a "bad day".

Unfortunately many interviews are a black box and you don't get feedback that 
would help you know what to focus on. Given this, it is left to you to analyze
the interview and figure out what went wrong. This is a dangerous proposition,
and can lead down a rabbit hole of despair that is hard to get out from and
be ready for the next interview. This is where caution is needed, resist that 
urge and just focus on the next interview.

We are in a fantastic time for being able to build confidence for technical
interviews. There are so many resources that let exercise your skills with any 
language you can imagine that give you direct feedback on how you are doing.
Platforms like [Hacker Rank](www.hackerrank.com) contain many interview type 
problems and let you write solutions in a variety of languages. These platforms
run your solution through tests that exercise the correctness both of the results
and the complexity. Doing as many of these as possible and passing all of the
tests is incredibly valuable for being prepared and for building confidence.

You can do practice interviews with experienced interviewers at places like
[Code Mentor](www.codementor.io). This will help with delivery and to get
honest feedback about how you did and why the interviewer would or would not
choose you based on the interview.

It is essential to remember that losing and interview does not mean that you
are unable to do the job. Interviewers must make a decision based on what
you demonstrate in the interview. They cannot infer or guess that you know that
thing that you stumbled on. Interviewers want to hire you, they are rooting for
you and want to help. They do still have a responsibility to their company to
hire only people in whom they have full confidence. This is why interviewers
are trained to be very cautious. This is also why most companies welcome and 
encourage repeat applications. They know that an individual interview is a roll
of the dice and that on a different day they would see that you are the perfect
candidate.

So don't be discouraged if you don't make it on the first try. Pull yourself
up again and get back out there and show them what you can do. If you don't get
one interview it is likely not because you can't do the job, but because it
just wasn't your time. Train hard, practice, and believe in yourself and you
will get the interview that really counts.
